A Hugo theme with no predefined colors and minimal styling. If you want source
code highlighting, take a look at
link:{uri-tomorrow-pygments}[tomorrow-pygments].

The theme is based on link:{uri-slick}[Slick]. Their
link:{uri-slick-example}[configuration example] is valid for nocolor too.

== Installation

Just download the theme or clone it into your `themes/` directory:

[source,shell]
----
cd themes && git clone https://schlomp.space/tastytea/hugo-theme-nocolor.git
----

Then reference it in your `config`:

[source,toml]
----
theme = "nocolor"
----

Or when building the site, pass it in to the CLI:

[source,shell]
----
hugo -t nocolor
----

== Modification

You can add things to the end of the `<head>` section by overwriting the partial
template `extra-head.html`. The common way to do it is to create
`layouts/partials/extra_head.html`.
