== Installation

[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git submodule add https://schlomp.space/tastytea/hugo-theme-nocolor.git themes/nocolor
echo 'theme = "nocolor"' >> config.toml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Configuration & Modification

Please take a look at the link:{uri-slick-example}[configuration example for
Slick]. It is valid for nocolor too.

You can add things to the end of the `<head>` section by overwriting the partial
template `extra-head.html` or above the footer by overwriting
`extra_foot.html`. The common way to do it is to create
`layouts/partials/extra_head.html` or `layouts/partials/extra_foot.html`,
respectively.

If you want source code highlighting, take a look at
link:{uri-tomorrow-pygments}[tomorrow-pygments].

== Good to know

Table of contents are only written when the word count exceeds 400 and the `toc`
field in your contentâ€™s front matter is set to true. See
link:{uri-hugo-doc-toc}[the Hugo documentation] for details. You can overwrite
the template by adding the file `layouts/partials/toc.html` to your blog.
