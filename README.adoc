*nocolor* is a link:{uri-hugo}[Hugo] theme with no predefined colors and minimal
styling. It is based on link:{uri-slick}[Slick].

== Features

* Supports taxonomies of tags, categories and series with their own pages.
* RSS Feed with complete entries.
* link:{uri-opengraph}[Open Graph], link:{uri-schema}[Schema.org] and
  link:{uri-twittercards}[Twitter Cards] support.
* Fully customizable menu entries.
* No JavaScript, no bundled fonts, no external requests.

== Installation

Just download the theme or clone it into your `themes/` directory:

[source,shell]
----
cd themes && git clone https://schlomp.space/tastytea/hugo-theme-nocolor.git
----

Then reference it in your `config`:

[source,toml]
----
theme = "nocolor"
----

Or when building the site, pass it in to the CLI:

[source,shell]
----
hugo -t nocolor
----

== Modification

Please take a look at the link:{uri-slick-example}[configuration example for
Slick]. It is valid for nocolor too.

You can add things to the end of the `<head>` section by overwriting the partial
template `extra-head.html`. The common way to do it is to create
`layouts/partials/extra_head.html`.

If you want source code highlighting, take a look at
link:{uri-tomorrow-pygments}[tomorrow-pygments].
